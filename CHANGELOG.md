# v0.1.2

Just updating some security stuff, and hopefully will be able to begin working on this project again soon.

# v0.1.1

This update makes the website mobile friendly (almost) in it's current state, and offically adds the fun console toy to mess with on the home page.

I just need to fix the dropdown menu thats it thats all I need to do I promise :3
